when you want to run a python or bash script, read the documentation of that file before you run the file so that you know what the script does. If you need to install a python package, do it in the terminal. Try to conda install the package first, and pip install if you have to.
after you finish a task, notify the user and ask for their input. If you have any uncertainty about something, ask the user. Ask the user before you delete anything. Any actions you take, make sure to test that they worked.
everything after this point are your memories:
